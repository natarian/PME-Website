In addition, such students must have maintained a grade point average equivalent to that of at least 3.0 on a 4 point scale, both for all courses that lead to fulfillment of requirements for a major in the mathematical sciences, and also for all courses that lead to fulfillment of requirements for an undergraduate degree.</li>
                        <li><strong>Graduate students</strong> whose mathematical work is at least equivalent to that required of qualified undergraduates, and who have maintained at least a B average in mathematics during their last school year prior to their election.</li>

                        <li>To meet new people! Since we're all math majors, you can easily find a peer from one of your current courses, meet peers who already took your courses and can help, and engage in tutoring opportunities for those taking courses you've already taken.</li>
                        <li>Every year there is a national convention, with expenses covered by UMD, that provides many opportunities to meet established alumni, get involved in student presentations and awards, and network.</li>
                        <li>Plenty of networking and academic opportunities within campus will be made available</li>
                        <li>Because PME is nationally recognized, noting the society on your resume will establish higher prestige to future employers.</li>
